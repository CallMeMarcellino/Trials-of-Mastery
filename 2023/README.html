<li> <h3> Do I have to follow the theme? No, the theme is completely optional. Additionally, there are no extra points for following it. </h3> </li>
<li> <h3> Do I need to use Godot? Yes, that's the whole point of this game jam: to improve your Godot skills, so if you don't use Godot, it won't make sense.</h3> </li>
</ul>

<h2></h2> <h2> Last Thing </h2>
<h3> The games that you submit to this jam, must be made for the jam. This jam is not a way to advertise your already-made games, it's a way to learn and improve your own skills. To help you when you create games in the future, or when your fixing games in the present. </h3>
